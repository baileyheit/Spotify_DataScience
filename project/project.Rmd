### Introduction

The goal of our project is to determine the qualities of a song that influence popularity on Spotify. The dataset was retrieved online from kaggle.com. The data is derived from the Spotify Web API, which uses internal Spotify metrics to determine the parameters of the dataset. For subjective variables such as danceability and instrumentalness, the Spotify Web API utilizes Echo Nest algorithms. The dataset curator retrieved data for 228159 songs at random and aggregated this information into the dataset. Because the data set was so large and difficult to analyze in R-studio, a random sample of 5000 data points was taken and a new csv file was made.

This project will analyze the variables of a song that correlate with a higher song popularity. To find this, song popularity is assigned as our dependent response variable and the other variables such as danceability, energy, and key as our predictor variables. Using backwards selection on a multiple regression models, the variables that are the best predictors of a song's popularity score can be predicted. Visualizations will be used to show  general trends in popularity through various the qualitative and quantitative variables. Bootstraps and permutations will look at whether significant differences exist between certain variables. Confidence intervals will also be constructed. These different statistical strategies all contribute to the research question of what qualities of a song contribute to its popularity. 

### Visualization

#### Exploratory Data Analysis of Relationships Between Different Variables and Song Popularity

In this section, an exploratory analysis of the relationships between song popularity and different variables was conducted, in order to determine which characteristics of songs are good predictors of the popularity of songs. 

Below, the group_by() and summarise() functions were used to find the median popularity of songs, based on their genres. Then, this data was arranged in decending order and it was found that the Pop genre has the greatest median song popularity and the movie genre has the lowest median song popularity. 

```{r median-popularity-genre, echo = FALSE}
songs_avg <- songs %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(medianpop = median(popularity)) %>%
  arrange(desc(medianpop))

ggplot(data = songs_avg, mapping = aes(x=reorder(genre, medianpop), y = medianpop))+
   geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "light green") + 
   labs(title = "Median Popularity Scores by Genre",
   x = "Genre", 
   y = "Median Popularity Score") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 55, hjust = 1))
```

#### Boxplots for Categorical Variables

The following boxplot visualizes the distribution of the genre with the highest median popularity (Pop) and the genre with the lowest median popularity (Movie). The Pop plot is relatively normal shaped, as the median is located in the center of the data. There appears to be three outliers in the data set, two above the median song popularity and one below the median song popularity. The movie plot is not normally shaped, as the majority of the data lies above the median in the upper quartile, making the plot slightly-right skewed. There appears to be four outliers in the data set, all of which lie above the median song popularity.

```{r plot-selectedgenres-popularity, echo = FALSE}
songs_genre <- songs %>%
  filter(genre == "Pop"| genre == "Movie")

ggplot(data = songs_genre, mapping = aes(x = genre, y = popularity)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "light green") +
  labs(title = "Comparing the Most Popular and Least Popular Genres", x = "Genres", y = "Popularity")+
  theme_light()
```

The following box plot visualizes the distribution of song popularity, based on the modality (mode) of the track. According to the visualization, the median popularity of songs with minor modalities is slightly higher than the median popularity of sons with major modalities. The minor plot is not normally shaped, as the majority of the data lies below the median, making the plot slightly left-skewed. There appears to be two outliers in the minor plot, both of which fall below the median song popularity of songs with minor modalities. The major plot is also not normally shaped, as the majority of the data lies below the median, making it slightly left-skewed. There appears to be one outlier in the major data, which falls above the median popularity of songs with major modalities. 

```{r plot-mode-popularity, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = songs, mapping = aes(x = mode, y = popularity, fill = mode)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Mode v. Popularity of Songs", x = "Mode", y = "Popularity")
```

The following boxplot visualizes the distribution of song popularity, based on the time-signature of each track. According to the visualization, the median song popularity is greatest when the time signature is 4/4 and the median song popularity is lowest when the time signature is 1/4. The 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4 plots are all relatively normally shaped, as the median song popularities fall in the center of the data plots. There do not appear to be any outliers in the 1/4, 3/4, and 5/4 data plots. The 4/4 data plot, however, is not normally shaped, as the majority of the data falls below the median song popularity, making it slightly left-skewed. There appears to be two outliers above the median song popularity of the 4/4 plot, and multiple outliers below the median song popularity of the 4/4 plot. 

```{r timesignature-popularity, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = songs, mapping = aes(x = time_signature, y = popularity, fill = time_signature)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Time Signature v. Popularity of Songs", x = "Time Signature", y = "Popularity")
```

The following boxplot visualizes the distribution of song popularity based on the keys of songs. According to the data, the key with the highest median song popularity is F#. Since there is little variability between the median popularities of songs, based on the track's key, key does not appear to be a strong predictor of song popularity. 

```{r plot-key-popularity,echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = songs, mapping = aes(x = key, y = popularity, fill = key)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Key v. Popularity of Songs", x = "Key", y = "Popularity")
```

#### Scatterplots for Numerical Variables
The following scatterplots visualizes the relationship between variables in the data and the popularity of the Spotify song. 

```{r plot-popularity, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 15}

  mutate(duration_s = duration_ms/1000) %>%
  filter(duration_s <= 800)
duration <- 
  ggplot(data = songs2, mapping = aes(x = duration_s, y = popularity, alpha = 0.0005)) +

  ggplot(data = songs3, mapping = aes(x = loudness, y = popularity, alpha = 0.0005)) +
  geom_point(color="dark gray") +

```

For the relationship between a confidence measure of whether songs are acoustic (acousticness) and the popularity of Spotify songs, there appears to be a generally indirect trend in the data. According to the visualization, as acousticness increases, song popularity decreases. The relationship between acousticness and song popularity is non-linear. 

For the relationship between energy and popularity of Spotify songs, there appears to be a generally direct trend in the data. According to the visualization,  as song  energy increases, song popularity increases as well. The relationship between energy and song popularity is non-linear. 

For the relationship between the how suitable a song is for dancing (danceability) and the popularity of Spotify songs, there appears to be a generally direct trend in the data. According to the visualization,  as danceability increases, song popularity increases as well. The relationship between danceability and song popularity is non-linear. 

Before creating the plot for the relationship between song durationo and popluarity, we used the mutate() function to create a new variable that measures the duration of songs in seconds. We also used the filter() function to remove extreme outliers from the data and make it easier to see observations in the heavily populated regions in the visualization.

For the relationship between the duration and popularity of songs on Spotify,  according to the data, songs with durations of about 200 seconds (3.33 minutes) have the highest average popularity. The relationship between song duration and popularity is non-linear. The majority of songs are under 600 seconds (10 minutes) long. Since the majority of Spotify songs are similar in length, duration does not appear to be a strong predictor of song popularity. 

For the relationship between whether songs are predicted to be majority instrumental (instrumentalness) and the popularity of songs, there appears to be a generally indirect trend in the data. According to the visualization, as the intrumentalness of a song increases, the popularity decreases. The relationship between instrumentalness and popularity is non-linear.

For the relationship between the liveliness that songs were preformed live (liveness) and the popularity of songs, there appears to be a generally indirect trend in the data. According to the visualization, as liveness increases, popularity decreases. The relationship between popularity and liveness is non-linear. 

Before creating the plot displaying the relationship between loudness and popularity, we filtered the loudness variable to remove extreme outliers from the data and make heavily populated regions of the visualization easier to see. This scatterplot appears to have a generally direct trend in the data. According to the visualizaiton, as loudness increases, popularity increases as well. The relationship between popularity and liveness is non-linear.

For the relationship between how exclusively speech-like songs are (speechiness) and the popularity of songs, there appears to be a generally indirect trend in the data. According to the visualization, as speechiness increases, popularity decreases. The relationship between popularity and speechiess is non-linear. 

For the relationship between the tempo and popularity of songs, there appears to be a generally direct trend in the data, where as tempo increases, popularity increases as well. The relationship between popularity and liveness is non-linear. 

For the relationship between the musical positiveness (valence) and the popularity of songs, although popularity appears to increase slightly as valence increases, there appears to be a generally constant relationship between the valence and popularity. The relationship between popularity and liveness is non-linear. 

From this exploratory analyses, it appears that genre, energy, danceability, loudness, and acousticness had the strongest relationships with song popularity. 

The variables that have a positive relationship with popularity are: energy, danceability, and loudness. The variables that have a negative relationship with popularity are: acoustiness, instrumentalness, liveness, and acousticness 

### Bootstrapping to find Confidence Intervals
#### Confidence Intervals for Categorical Variables

After conducting the exploratory data analysis, we wanted to further investigate the relationships between individual variables and song popularity.
In this section, bootstrapping was used to determine the confidence intervals for the difference in mean popularity scores between different categories within variables that appeared to have the strongest relationship with popularity scores. For example, the confidence interval for the difference in mean popularity scores between the Rap and Pop genres (the most popular 2 genres) were calculated. 

##### Estimate of the Popularity Difference between Rap and Pop Genres 

```{r rap_pop, echo = FALSE}

songs_gen <- songs %>%
  filter(genre == "Rap"|genre == "Pop")

boot_rap_pop <- songs_gen %>%
   specify(response = popularity, explanatory = genre) %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
   calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Pop", "Rap"))

ggplot(data = boot_rap_pop, mapping = aes(x=stat)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Difference in Mean Popularity", subtitle = "Pop - Rap", x = "Difference in Popularity")
```

```{r conf_rap_pop, echo = FALSE}
lower_bound <- boot_rap_pop %>%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025))
lower_bound
upper_bound <- boot_rap_pop %>%
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
upper_bound
```
We are 95% certain that the difference in means between the popularity score of the rap and pop genres is between `r lower_bound` and `r upper_bound`. 

##### Estimate of the Popularity Difference between 4/4 Time Signature and Non-4/4 Time Signature

From the boxplot in the visualizations section, we can see that the 4/4 time signature had a higher average popularity score than the rest of the time signatures. Thus, we decided to construct a confidence interval estimating the difference in popularity means between songs with a 4/4 time signature and songs that do not use a 4/4 time signature. 

```{r time_signature_new, echo = FALSE}
   
time_signature_songs <- songs %>%
   mutate(time_signatureHL = case_when(
    time_signature == "4/4" ~ "4/4",
    TRUE ~ "Not 4/4")) %>%
   filter(! is.na(time_signatureHL))

time_signature_songs %>%
   group_by(time_signatureHL) %>%
   summarise(average = mean(popularity))
```
We can see that songs with 4/4 time signature have an average popularity score that is around 10 higher than songs that do not have a 4/4 time signature. 

```{r time_signature_boot, echo = FALSE}

boot_time_signature <- time_signature_songs %>%
   specify(response = popularity, explanatory = time_signatureHL) %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
   calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("4/4", "Not 4/4"))

ggplot(data = boot_time_signature, mapping = aes(x=stat)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Difference in Mean Popularity", subtitle = "4/4 - Not 4/4", x = "Difference in Popularity")
```

```{r conf_time_signature, echo = FALSE}
lower_bound0 <- boot_time_signature %>%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025))
lower_bound0
upper_bound0 <- boot_time_signature %>%
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
upper_bound0
```
We are 95% certain that the difference in popularity means between the songs with higher (highest 25%) time_signature and the lower (lowest 25%) time_signature is between `r lower_bound0` and `r upper_bound0`.

#### Confidence Intervals for Continous Variables

The following variables were selected because the scatterplot visualizations mapping them against popularity scores showed there was a clear relationship between the variables and the scores. The variables that were chosen are: danceability, energy, liveness, loudness, and acousticness. 

For each of these variables, we took the highest 25% of the data ("High" danceability, energy, liveness etc.) and the lowest 25% of the data ("Low" danceability, energy, liveness etc.) and conducted a 95% confidence interval test for the difference in mean popularities between the two. 

##### Danceability

```{r dance_info, echo = FALSE}
songs %>%
   summarise(max = max(danceability), min = min(danceability), q1 = quantile(danceability, probs = 0.25), q3 = quantile(danceability, probs = 0.75))

```

```{r dance_new, echo = FALSE}
dance_songs <- songs %>%
   mutate(danceHL = case_when(
    danceability >= 0.437 ~ "High",
    danceability <= 0.69 ~ "Low"))

dance_songs %>%
   group_by(danceHL) %>%
   summarise(average = mean(popularity))
```
Songs with high danceability have a mean popularity score that is around 10 higher compared songs with low danceability. 

```{r dance_boot, echo = FALSE}

boot_dance <- dance_songs %>%
   specify(response = popularity, explanatory = danceHL) %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
   calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))

ggplot(data = boot_dance, mapping = aes(x=stat)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Difference in Mean Popularity", subtitle = "High - Low", x = "Difference in Popularity")
```

```{r conf_dance, echo = FALSE}
lower_bound1 <- boot_dance %>%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025))
lower_bound1
upper_bound1 <- boot_dance %>%
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
upper_bound1
```
We are 95% certain that the difference in popularity means between the songs with high danceability and low danceability is between `r lower_bound1` and `r upper_bound1`.

##### Energy 

```{r energy_info, echo = FALSE}
songs %>%
   summarise(max = max(energy), min = min(energy), q1 = quantile(energy, probs = 0.25), q3 = quantile(energy, probs = 0.75))

```

```{r energy_new, echo = FALSE}
   
energy_songs <- songs %>%
   mutate(energyHL = case_when(
    energy >= 0.793 ~ "High",
    energy <= 0.405 ~ "Low")) %>%
   filter(! is.na(energyHL))

energy_songs %>%
   group_by(energyHL) %>%
   summarise(average = mean(popularity))
```
Songs with high energy have a mean popularity score that is around 10 higher compared songs with low energy. 

```{r energy_boot, echo = FALSE}

boot_energy <- energy_songs %>%
   specify(response = popularity, explanatory = energyHL) %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
   calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))

ggplot(data = boot_energy, mapping = aes(x=stat)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Difference in Mean Popularity", subtitle = "High - Low", x = "Difference in Popularity")
```

```{r conf_energy, echo = FALSE}
lower_bound2 <- boot_energy %>%
  summarize(lower_bound = quantile(stat, 0.025))
lower_bound2
upper_bound2 <- boot_energy %>%
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
upper_bound2
```
We are 95% certain that the difference in means between songs with high  energy and low energy is between `r lower_bound2` and `r upper_bound2`.

##### Loudness 

```{r loudness_info, echo = FALSE}
songs %>%
   summarise(max = max(loudness), min = min(loudness), q1 = quantile(loudness, probs = 0.25), q3 = quantile(loudness, probs = 0.75))

```

```{r loudness_new, echo = FALSE}
   
loudness_songs <- songs %>%
   mutate(loudnessHL = case_when(
    loudness >= -5.36 ~ "High",
    loudness <= -11.34 ~ "Low")) %>%
   filter(! is.na(loudnessHL))

loudness_songs %>%
   group_by(loudnessHL) %>%
   summarise(average = mean(popularity))
```
Songs with high loudness have a mean popularity score that is around 18 higher compared with songs with low loudness. 

```{r loudness_boot, echo = FALSE}

boot_loudness <- loudness_songs %>%
   specify(response = popularity, explanatory = loudnessHL) %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
   calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))

ggplot(data = boot_loudness, mapping = aes(x=stat)) + geom_histogram() + labs(title = "Bootstrap Distribution of Difference in Mean Popularity", subtitle = "High Loudness - Low Loudness", x = "Difference in Popularity")
```

```{r conf_loudness, echo = FALSE}
lower_bound4 <- boot_loudness %>%

lower_bound4
upper_bound4 <- boot_loudness %>%
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
upper_bound4
```
We are 95% certain that the difference in mean popularity scores between songs with high loudness and the low loudness is between `r lower_bound4` and `r upper_bound4`.

##### Acousticness 

```{r acousticness_info, echo = FALSE}
songs %>%
   summarise(max = max(acousticness), min = min(acousticness), q1 = quantile(acousticness, probs = 0.25), q3 = quantile(acousticness, probs = 0.75))

```

```{r acousticness_new, echo = FALSE}
   
acousticness_songs <- songs %>%

    acousticness >= 0.703 ~ "High",
    acousticness <= 0.0303 ~ "Low")) %>%
   filter(! is.na(acousticnessHL))

acousticness_songs %>%
   group_by(acousticnessHL) %>%
   summarise(average = mean(popularity))
```
Songs with high acousticness have a mean popularity score that is around 18 lower compared songs with low acousticness. 

```{r acousticness_boot, echo = FALSE}

boot_acousticness <- acousticness_songs %>%
   specify(response = popularity, explanatory = acousticnessHL) %>%
   generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
   calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))

lower_bound5
upper_bound5 <- boot_acousticness %>%
  summarize(upper_bound = quantile(stat, 0.975))
upper_bound5
```
We are 95% certain that the difference in popularity means between songs with high  acousticness and the low acousticness is between `r lower_bound5` and `r upper_bound5`.

### Permutation Analysis
```{r nrep, echo = FALSE}
nrep <- 1000
```
#### Popularity Difference Between Pop and Rap 

After conducting the exploratory data analysis, the visualization of the distribution of song popularity based on genres suggested that the Pop and Rap genres had the greatest median song popularities. As a result, we wanted to see if the difference in song popularity between these two genres is significant. 

Null Hypothesis: There is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that are pop and songs that are rap. 
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference between the mean popularities of songs that are pop and songs that are rap.

```{r observed-difference-pop, echo = FALSE}
songs_poprap <- songs%>%
  filter(genre=="Pop" | genre == "Rap")
mean_poprap <- songs_poprap %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%  
  summarise(samp_mean = mean(popularity)) %>%
  summarise(diff(samp_mean)) %>%
  pull()
mean_poprap
```

The observed difference between the mean popularity of Pop and the mean popularity of Rap is 6.15. 

```{r null-dist-pop, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_poprap <- songs_poprap %>%
  specify(response = popularity, explanatory = genre) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = nrep, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("Pop", "Rap"))
ggplot(data = null_dist_poprap, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_poprap, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1 * mean_poprap, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Null distribution of differences in popularity means for pop or rap songs")
```

```{r p-value-pop, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_poprap %>%
  filter(stat <= mean_poprap) %>%
  summarise(pvalue = 2 * (n() / nrep))
```
The p-value of the difference between the popularity of Pop and Rap songs is 0%, which is the proportion of observations that are at least as extreme or more extreme than the observed difference in means (6.15). Since 0% is less than a significance level of 5%, the null hypothesis is rejected, meaning that the data provides convincing evidence that there is a difference in mean popularities of songs that are Pop versus Rap. 

#### Popularity Difference Between High Energy and Low Energy
From the visualizations, we saw that songs with more energy were more likely to have a greater popularity. We wanted to see if the difference in popularity between sonogs with high and low energy (defined as songs with energy at or above .5 and energy below .5 respectively) was significant. 

Null Hypothesis: There is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high energy and low energy.
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high energy and low energy.

```{r observed-difference-energy, echo = FALSE}
songs <- songs%>%
  mutate(energyLevel = case_when(
    energy >= .5 ~ "High",
    energy < .5 ~ "Low"
  ))
mean_energy <- songs %>%
  group_by(energyLevel) %>%  
  summarise(samp_mean = mean(popularity)) %>%
  summarise(diff(samp_mean)) %>%
  pull()
mean_energy
```
The observed mean popularity difference between songs with high and low energyy is 9.688. 

```{r null-dist-energy, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_energy <- songs %>%
  specify(response = popularity, explanatory = energyLevel) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = nrep, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))
ggplot(data = null_dist_energy, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_energy, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1 * mean_energy, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Null distribution of differences in popularity means based on energy")
```

```{r p-value-energy, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_energy %>%
  filter(stat <= mean_energy) %>%
  summarise(pvalue = 2 * (n() / nrep))
```
The p-value of the difference between high and low energy is 0, which mean we can reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high energy and low energy. The data provides convincing evidence that there is a difference in mean popularities of songs that have high energy versus low energy. 

#### Popularity Difference Between High Danceability and Low Danceabililty
From the visualizations, we saw that songs with more danceability were more likely to have a greater popularity. We wanted to see if the difference in popularity between sonogs with high and low danceability (defined as songs with danceabililty at or above .5 and danceability below .5 respectively) was significant. 

Null Hypothesis: There is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high danceability and low danceability
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high danceability and low danceability

```{r observed-difference-dance, echo = FALSE}
songs <- songs%>%
  mutate(danceLevel = case_when(
    danceability >= .5 ~ "High",
    danceability < .5 ~ "Low"
  ))
mean_dance <- songs %>%
  group_by(danceLevel) %>%  
  summarise(samp_mean = mean(popularity)) %>%
  summarise(diff(samp_mean)) %>%
  pull()
mean_dance
```
The observed mean popularity difference between songs with high and low danceabiliity is 8.56. 

```{r null-dist-dance, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_dance <- songs %>%
  specify(response = popularity, explanatory = danceLevel) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = nrep, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))
ggplot(data = null_dist_dance, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_dance, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1 * mean_dance, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Null distribution of differences in popularity means based on danceability")
```

```{r p-value-dance, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_dance %>%
  filter(stat <= mean_dance) %>%
  summarise(pvalue = 2 * (n() / nrep))
```

The p-value of the difference between high and low danceability is 0, which means we can reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high danceability and low danceability The data provides convincing evidence that there is a difference in mean popularities of songs that have high danceability versus low danceability 

#### Popularity Difference Between High Speechiness and Low Speechiness
From the visualizations, we saw that songs with more speechiness were more likely to have a greater popularity. We wanted to see if the difference in popularity between sonogs with high and low speechiness (defined as songs with speechiness at or above .5 and speechiness below .5 respectively) was significant. 

Null Hypothesis: There is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high speechiness and low speechiness
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high speechiness and low speechiness

```{r observed-difference-speech, echo = FALSE}
songs <- songs%>%
  mutate(speechLevel = case_when(
    speechiness >= .5 ~ "High",
    speechiness < .5 ~ "Low"
  ))
mean_speech <- songs %>%
  group_by(speechLevel) %>%  
  summarise(samp_mean = mean(popularity)) %>%
  summarise(diff(samp_mean)) %>%
  pull()
mean_speech
```
The observed mean popularity difference between songs with high and low speechiness is 23.09. 
```{r null-dist-speech, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_speech <- songs %>%
  specify(response = popularity, explanatory = speechLevel) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = nrep, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))
ggplot(data = null_dist_speech, aes(x = stat)) +

  geom_vline(xintercept = -1 * mean_speech, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Null distribution of differences in popularity means based on speechiness")
```

The p-value of the difference between high and low speechiness is 0, which means we can reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high speechiness and low speechiness The data provides convincing evidence that there is a difference in mean popularities of songs that have high speechiness versus low speechiness. 

#### Popularity Difference Between High Valence and Low Valence
From the linear model, we saw that songs with less valence were more likely to have a greater popularity. We wanted to see if the difference in popularity between songs with high and low valence (defined as songs with valence at or above .5 and valence below .5 respectively) was significant. 

Null Hypothesis: There is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high valence and low valence
Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high valence and low valence

```{r observed-difference-valence, echo = FALSE}
songs <- songs%>%
  mutate(valenceLevel = case_when(
    valence >= .5 ~ "High",
    valence < .5 ~ "Low"
  ))
mean_valence <- songs %>%
  group_by(valenceLevel) %>%  
  summarise(samp_mean = mean(popularity)) %>%
  summarise(diff(samp_mean)) %>%
  pull()
mean_valence
```
The observed difference in mean popularity between songs with high and low valence is 2.12. 

```{r null-dist-valence, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_valence <- songs %>%
  specify(response = popularity, explanatory = valenceLevel) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = nrep, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("High", "Low"))
ggplot(data = null_dist_valence, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_valence, color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -1 * mean_valence, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Null distribution of differences in popularity means based on speechiness")
```

```{r p-value-valence, echo = FALSE}
null_dist_valence %>%
  filter(stat <= mean_valence) %>%
  summarise(pvalue = 2 * (n() / nrep))
```

The p-value of the difference between high and low valence is 0, which means we can reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference between the mean popularities of songs that have high valence and low valence. The data provides convincing evidence that there is a difference in mean popularities of songs that have high valence versus low valence. 

### Linear Regression

After conducting an exploratory analysis through multiple visualizations, and examining strong individual relationships between song popularity and genre, energy, danceability, loudness, and speechiness, we wanted to find the best fit model of the variables that maximize the popularity of a song. To do this, a multiple linear regression model was created and backwards selection was utilized to determine the best model. 

This is the selected multiple linear regression model using backwards selection. It looks at the relationship between popularity and different variables. Genre is not included in this model.
```{r selected-model-nogenre, echo = FALSE}

full_model_nogenre = lm(popularity ~ acousticness +
                  danceability +
                  energy +
                  instrumentalness +
                  liveness +
                  loudness +
                  speechiness + 
                  tempo + 
                  valence,
                data = songs)

nogenre_model <- step(full_model_nogenre, direction = "backward")

nogenre_model 

glance(nogenre_model)$r.squared
glance(nogenre_model)$adj.r.squared
```
Selected model = 57.28 + -13.77 * acousticness + 16.52 * danceability - 6.24 * energy - 3.62 * instrumentalness + -11.85 * liveness + 0.78 * loudness + -7.72 * speechiness + 0.013 * tempo + -9.29 * valence

The adjusted R squared value for this model is 0.30, which means that roughly 30% of the variability in a song's popularity can be explained by the different variables in the multiple regression model. This indicates that there is a weak to moderate positive overall realtionship between a song's popularity and the different variables related to a song.

This is the selected multiple linear regression model using backwards selection. It looks at the relationship between popularity and different variables. Genre is included in this model.
```{r selected-model, echo = FALSE}

full_model = lm(popularity ~ acousticness +
                  danceability +
                  energy +
                  instrumentalness +
                  liveness +
                  loudness +
                  speechiness + 
                  tempo + 
                  genre +
                  valence,
                data = songs)

selected_model <- step(full_model, direction = "backward")

selected_model

glance(selected_model)$r.squared
glance(selected_model)$adj.r.squared
```

score_hat = 9.15 + 3.28 * danceability + 0.12 * loudness - 2.055 * speechiness - 1.32 * valence + 44.97 * alternative + 44.67 * anime + 45.81 * Blues + 45.82 * children's music + 24.01 * classical + 13.65 * comedy + 37.92 * country + 47.85 * dance + 28.50 * electronic + 40.34 * folk + 49.09 * hip-hop + 45.57 * indie + 31.07 * jazz + 1.94 * movie + 4.96 * opera + 56.81 * pop + 42.54 * R&B + 51.31 * rap + 26.72 * reggae + 27.86 * reggaeton + 49.95 * rock + 19.29 * Ska + 37.95 * soul + 25.83 * soundtrack + 27.13 * world 

Through experimenting with different multiple regression models, it is found that genre is the most influential predictor of popularity. Without genre as a part of this model, no variables are removed using backwards selection. When genre is a part of the model, most of the variables are selected out the model. For the ones that do remain (danceability, loudness, speechiness, and valence) their coefficients are small which shows that they do not heavily influence popularity. 

When all variables have a value of 0, then it is expected that a song's populariy is 9.15. One example of how a variable influences the popularity is danceabiliy If a song's acoustic score increases by 1 then popularity will increases by 3.28 points. It can be seen that popularity is increased most when the genre is either pop or rap. Popularity is, on average, higher by 56.81 if a song is under the rap genre than any of the other genres, all else held constant. Popularity is, on average, 51.31 points higher if the song is a rap song as opposed to any other song, all else held constant. This makes sense because the two most popular genres are rap and pop. This is in contras to the movie genre where popularity is only 1.94 points higher on average if it is under the movie genre compared to any other genre, all else held constant. It is interesting to note that no genres cause the popularity to decrease. 

The adjusted R squared value for this model is 0.71, which means that roughly 71.0% of the variability in a song's popularity can be explained by the different variables in the multiple regression model. This indicates that there is a strong positive overall relationship between a song's popularity and the different variables related to a song. When looking at individual r-value models, it can be seen that genre is the variable that contributes to the high r-value. Without it, the selected model r-value is .30. 


### Conclusion

Our initial visualizations showed us that continous variables energy, danceability, and loudness had a positive relationship with popularity, suggesting that spotify songs with high energy, danceability, and loudness are more likely to be popular. We also saw that the variables acousticness, instrumentalness, speechiness, and liveness tended to have a negative relationship with popularity scores, suggesting that songs with low acousticness, instrumentalness, speechiness and liveness are more likely to be popular on spotify. Variables that showed the strongest relationship with popularity scores were energy, danceability, loudness, and acousticness. For categorical variables, we saw that there seemed to be a strong relationship between genre and popularity scores, and time signatures and popularity scores. After seeing which variables appeared to influence popularity the most, we used linear regression and bootstrapping to help verify which variables actually had a significant effect on popularity.

The results of our model selection showed that genre is the strongest predictor of popularity scores. The best model with the highest R-squared value was the model containing genre, danceability, loudness, speechiness, and valence. There were a few things that we found surprising in the result of the model selection. First, the selected model did not include energy, even though the visualizations showed a strong, positive relationship between energy and danceability. Second, the selected model included valence, which during our initial visualizations did not show a clear relationship with popularity scores. The rest of the results were as expected by the visualizations we had produced. Variables that showed a positive relationship with popularity scores in the scatter plot had a positive coefficient, and variables that showed a negative relationship with popularity scores in the plot had a negative coefficient.

Our permutation and bootstrapping analyses were conducted in order to verify the trends noted in our initial visualizations and the model selection result. The permutation tests showed that there is indeed a significant difference in popularity scores between the variables in the selected model (danceability, speechiness, and valence). We also observed a significant difference in popularity scores between the rap and pop genres and the major and minor modes. 

^^ lack consistency in the variables we investigated.. 

acousticness??? <- The selected model coefficient indicates that acousticness has a positive relationship with song popularity, whereas our visualizations and confidence intervals show that low acousticness results in a lower popularity score. These inconsistencies in our results reveal that acousticness is most likely not a good predictor of spotify song popularity. 

valence <- Even though the visualizations showed that there seemed to be no clear relationship between valence and song popularity, the model selection result revealed that valence is one of the better predictors of song popularity, and our permutation result shows that there is indeed a significant difference between the popularity scores of high and low valence songs. 

Overall, genre is the strongest indicator of song popularity. This makes logical sense because Spotify's largest listening population is millenials. Millenials generally spend more time listening to pop and rap as opposed to classical music. Other patterns may arise because certain genres tend to have similar musical properties. 

In future research, it would be important to find a data set that has a manageable amount of data points. Our group ran into trouble generating a random sample of 5000 data points. It is possible that if we took a different sample then the results may have been differently. Additionally, it would be important to focus on a few variables instead of surveying all of the variables to begin with. It was difficult to pull together a cohesive storyline when juggling such a large amount of variables. Looking at the relationships between the explanatory variables would be interesting to look at if our focus was not primarily on song popularity.
