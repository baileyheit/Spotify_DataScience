```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(infer)
library(broom)
songs_complete <- read_csv("/cloud/project/data/SpotifyFeatures.csv")
```

```{r songs-less}

songs <- sample_n(songs_complete, 5000, replace = FALSE)

songs
```



Your project goes here! Before you submit, make sure your chunks are turned off with `echo = FALSE`. 

You can add sections as you see fit. Make sure you have a section called Introduction at the beginning and a section called Conclusion at the end. The rest is up to you!
